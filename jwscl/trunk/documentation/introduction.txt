JEDI Windows Security Library BETA 0.7
This is the preliminary version of JWSCL.

The suite is a bunch of classes that encapsulated MS Windows security functions in object oriented way.

The goal of this project is to make security easier to delphi programmers. This includes that
the programmer must not allocate Windows API memory and also free it. Also (s)he can use simple Delphi String (Ansi- and WideString)
in all function that needs string manipulation. The memory allocation and deallocation for these things is done internally with a content check.
Of course it is possible to retrieve winapi structures easily to use in other winapi calls (e.g. TJwSecurityDescriptor.Create_SD). The caller
also has to free it using a counter part function (e.g. TJwSecurityDescriptor.Free_SD). 

Also api functions are wrapped together in classes to diminish initialization that consumes a great amount of time which (s)he
could use for better things. All the programmer has to do is to free the class instance after (s)he has used it.

However it is not the goal to teach delphi programmers how to program in windows security or create secure windows applications.
The programmer has to understand the security of windows by himself/herself. To use these classes (s)he must know 
what tokens, principals, secure objects, sessions and so on are. 

On the other hand if you want to test the software by creating good test scenarios (module, function, class, integration testing) you are welcome.
With good tests I mean tests that are reproducable, have a high function cover and uses Dunit.

This library has beta status and is surely not bug free. Do not use for production.
